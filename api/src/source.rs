//! A [`Source`] yields items, and may also fail in the process.
//! This module also provides two specialized kinds of source:
//! [`TripleSource`] and [`QuadSource`].
//!
//! The [`Source`] trait provides an API similar to (a subset of) the [`Iterator`] API,
//! with methods such as [`for_each_item`] and [`try_for_each_item`].
//! [`TripleSource`] and [`QuadSource`] provides specialized alternative
//! (e.g. [`for_each_triple`] and [`for_each_quad`], respectively).
//!
//! # Rationale (or Why not simply use `Iterator`?)
//!
//! The [`Iterator`] trait is designed in such a way that items must live at least as long as the iterator itself.
//! This assumption may be too strong in some situations.
//!
//! For example,
//! consider a parser using 3 buffers to store the subject, predicate,
//! and object of the triples it parses.
//! Each time it extracts a triple from the data,
//! it yields it (as 3 references to its internal buffers)
//! to the closure passed to `for_each_triple`.
//! Then, it **reuses** the buffers to store the data for the next triple,
//! and yields the new triple, as 3 references to the *same* buffers.
//!
//! Such a parser can not implement [`Iterator`],
//! because, once yielded by the iterator's `next` method,
//! an item is free to live during further iterations.
//! In particular, it can be stored in a collection,
//! and still be alive when the `next` method is called again
//! (consider for example the [`Iterator::collect`] method).
//!
//! Because many parsers (as well as other triple/quad sources)
//! will be implemented in a manner similar to that described above,
//! we have to provide a trait with *weaker assumptions*
//! on the lifetime of the yielded triples.
//!
//! The alternative would be to wrap such parsers with a layer that would *copy*
//! the data from internal buffers to fresh buffers for each triples,
//! but we do not want to impose that cost on all implementations
//! — especially when many consumers will be happy with short-lived references.
//!
//! # About the design of [`TripleSource`] and [`QuadSource`]
//!
//! The design of [`TripleSource`] (resp. [`QuadSource`]) may seem overcomplicated,
//! but it aims to have the following properties.
//!
//! * When a concrete type implements [`Source`] and its items implement
//!   [`Triple`](crate::triple::Triple), then it is automatically recognized as a
//!   [`TripleSource`].
//! * When a [`TripleSource`] is required, it can be used as a simple trait bound,
//!   without requiring the user to add a higher ranked trait bound (HRTB) like
//!   `for <'x> S:Item<'x>: Triple`.
//!
//! [`for_each_item`]: Source::for_each_item
//! [`try_for_each_item`]: Source::try_for_each_item
//! [`for_each_triple`]: TripleSource::for_each_triple
//! [`for_each_quad`]: QuadSource::for_each_quad
//! [higher-rank trait bounds]: https://doc.rust-lang.org/nomicon/hrtb.html
