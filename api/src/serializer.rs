//! API for serializing RDF syntaxes.
//!
//! This module specifies, through dedicated traits,
//! how serialization of triples/graphs and quads/dataset is handled in sophia.
//! These traits are designed with the idea that each serializer has a specific
//! “target” (typically a file or something similar)
//! associated to it.
//! If you want to serialize to two different files,
//! you must create two different serializers.
//!
//! Note however that this API does not cover the creation of serializers,
//! and therefore does not cover how their target is specified.
